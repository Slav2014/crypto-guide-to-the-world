<h1>Cameroon</h1>

<p>
	Cameroon's government first demonstrated its intend to embrace crypto-currencies in July 2016, when it organized a month-long experiment involved halve-a-thousand people from a small community using a digital currency "Trest". This experiment was officially reported to be a success, leading to a rising expectations that increasing number of people without a banking account may soon receive an access to wide variety of banking and financial services in this African nation.
</p>
<p>
	However, today, after almost two years passed since this initial test those hopes have remained illusory. Although, technically, citizens of Cameroon are free to buy, sell and hold crypto-currencies, use cases of digital money in this country are mostly boiled down to several Cameroonian startups providing an access to reduced number of local Bitcoin exchange platforms.
</p>
<p>
	At the same time, the legal status of the new cryptographic medium of exchange in Cameroon remains officially undefined due to an absence of clearly formulated guidance on its usage from part of <a href="https://www.beac.int/">"Banque des Etats de l'Afrique Centrale" or BEAC</a>, which is the central bank of <a href="https://www.cemac.int/">the Economic and Monetary Community of Central Africa</a> (CEMAC) unifying six states: Cameroon, Congo, Gabon, Equatorial Guinea, Chad and Central Africa.
</p>
<p>
	On the other hand, a limited interference of a central government with Cameroonian crypto-community may be a positive sign for its future, which lands the task of crypto-market development squarely in the hands of audacious local entrepreneurs.
