<h1>Belarus</h1>

<p>
	Manufacturing sector contributes more than 40% to Belarus's GDP but high-tech industries are mostly underdeveloped. Local startups founders have an advantage in low labor and material costs but high administrative barriers, low-income population, brain-drainage and shortage of seed and VC financing have grossly undermined local startups ecosystem's growth perspectives.
</p>
<p>
	According to the decree number eight, named <a href="http://president.gov.by/ru/official_documents_ru/view/dekret-8-ot-21-dekabrja-2017-g-17716/">"On the development of the digital economy"</a>, which will be enacted on 28 March 2018, using crypto-currencies in Belarus are declared legal providing Belarusian will be processing all their digital money transactions through residents of government's controlled special zone for IT entrepreneurs "High Technological Park".
</p>
<p>
	This zone, launched in 2015, contains around 200 startups companies, which enjoy various tax and legal allowances from Belarusian authorities. Mining and trading crypto, organizing ICOs as well as serving as go-between all other citizens and the crypto-world are now added to this list of government's backed privileges. Additionally, all those crypto related activities will stay tax exempt until 2023.

	Business Notes for Startups Founders:
	<ul>		
		<li>political climate: not friendly;</li>
		<li>economic climate: not friendly;</li>
		<li>regions to focus: locally;</li>
		<li>industries to focus: mobile e-services, SaaS, entertainment;</li>
		<li>major limitations: government regulated stagnating economy (GDP growth rate is slightly above 0%), high CB interest rate (exceeds 11%), high administrative and legal barriers to SME, brain-drainage, fixed Internet penetration rate is around 60%, shortage of seed and VC financing, low middle-income consumers (per-capita is below $6,000);</li>
		<li>stimulus: low costs, low competition, population is about 10 million;</li>
		<li>opportunities: to create an e-business aimed at the young urban users of mobile Internet.</li>
		<li>Cryptocurrencies and ICOs (outlook): restricted legality (moderately negative)</li>
	</ul>
