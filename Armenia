	In 2014 the Central Bank of the Republic of Armenia informed its citizens that "virtual currencies, including Bitcoins are not considered electronic money" and advised them not to use crypto under any circumstances "given the absence of clear-cut approaches on this issue in international practice". However, this opinion of local finance gate-keepers haven't been converted yet in the restrictive regulatory acts. Meanwhile, trading cryptocurrencies and organizing ICOs stay legal in Armenia.
