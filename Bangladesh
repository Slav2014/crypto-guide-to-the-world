<h1>Bangladesh</h1>
<p>
	According to the Bangladeshi Central Bank's statement, issued September 2017, "anybody caught using the virtual currency could be jailed under the country's anti-money laundering laws". Transacting with Bitcoin or any other crypto-currency is punishable by up to twelve years in jail. As to mining it's confusing. Technically speaking, thought, depending on a prosecutorâ€™s own opinion, "mining" Bitcoin may or may not be considered as "using" it.

<p>
	Nonetheless, in Bangladesh under the present circumstances, you are better to exercise a certain level of discretion while dealing with crypto in any capacity (as a miner or otherwise). The growing popularity of nationalist, right-wing politics in Bangladesh doesn't leave any hope that this extremist official backlash on the digital economy will be over any time soon.
