	The Central Bank of the Republic of San Marino (CBSM), which is the main financial regulatory authorities in the country, has not yet expressed its position on digital currencies, leaving Bitcoin and other crypto in the gray legal zone. However, trading cryptocurrencies as well as organizing ICOs are technically legal in Sam Marino. CBSM's official position on the matter will most likely be influenced by the Banca d'Italia.
