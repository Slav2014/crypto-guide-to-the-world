<h1> Afghanistan </h1>
<p>
	In Afghanistan specific law regarding Bitcoin is absent. It is still a very new phenomenon, especially in the country-side regions, where the only way to access Internet is through satellite connections. Local regulatory bodies, including Da Afghanistan Bank and Ministry of Finance haven't yet expressed their view on the cryptocurrencies. Meanwhile trading crypto as well as organizing ICOs both stay technically legal in Afghanistan.
