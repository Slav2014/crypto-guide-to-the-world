<h2 align = 'center'> Syria (Syrian Arab Republic) </h2>

<p>
	The Central Bank of Syria and other country's financial regulatory authorities haven't yet clarified their official position on crypto-currencies. Meanwhile, trading crypto as well as organizing ICOs remain legal in Syria. In a foreseeable future, even if some restrictions or a complete ban on using digital money are introduced in this country, it will be very difficult, if possible at all, to enforce its on all of country's territory.

		<li>regions to focus: locally, Middle East;</li>
		<li>industries to focus: e-commerce, education, advertisement;</li>
		<li>major limitations: prewar economy was based on oil extraction, which constituted about 60% of Syrian export revenues, GDP annual growth rate at (minus) -6 percent, inflation at almost 50 percent, inadequate legal regulation, unsound or destroyed infrastructure, near absence of seed and VC capitals, limited workforce, poor population (per capita at $1700);</li>
		<li>stimulus: young population, new market niches, low competitions.</li>
