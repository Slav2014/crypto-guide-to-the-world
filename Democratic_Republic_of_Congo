	Despite Congolese franc's (CDF) continuous devaluation, which, in 2017 alone, reduced its value for more than a halve, country's population refuses to embrace crypto-currencies as an alternative store of value, flocking to USD instead. There can be several reasons to rationalize this local phenomena, including, fixed Internet's very low penetration rate, consumer's over-dependence on cash transactions and a monopolized, centrally controlled economy.
</p>
<p>
	Under this set of circumstances, even after one of the largest African crypto-exchanges, which is based in Nairobi, announced that it launched the localized version of its site aimed at Congolese users, it hasn't resulted in notable rise of demand for digital money. Only at the beginning of 2018 there appeared information in national media, which may signify some slight surge of interest towards crypto from part of local mining corporations, some of which will allow purchasers of their bonds to pay its value in BTC or ETH.
</p> 
<p>
	The one positive side of such comparatively low interest towards crypto within the Congolese society may be that neither <a href="https://www.centralbanking.com/central-banking/central-bank-profile/2480668/central-bank-of-the-democratic-republic-of-congo">"Banque Centrale du Congo"</a> nor <a href="http://www.dgi.gouv.cd/">Tax Authority (DGI)</a> manage to introduce any regulations or limits on crypto-currencies circulation in the country, which still leaves Congolese people some time to joint world-wide crypto-community.
