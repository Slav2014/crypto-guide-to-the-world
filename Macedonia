<h1>Macedonia</h1>
<p>
	 The status of crypto-currencies in Macedonia isn't clear. On the one side, paying in crypto is not legal there and using digital money is discouraged by the National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia. On the other, in neighboring states, like Kosovo, mining crypto is booming, and Macedonian population, which enjoys one of the highest fixed Internet penetration rate in Eastern Europe, do not want to miss on multiple opportunities, which new digital economy presents to everybody.

<p>
	 As in many other countries around the world it creates the conflict of interest where national governments, which actively try to suppress crypto, find themselves in a position of fighting against the will of its own people. How this conflict will be resolved in Macedonia is still an open questions. Meanwhile trading crypto as well as organizing ICOs remain in the "gray" legal zone in Macedonia.
