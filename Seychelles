	In November 2016 the Seychelles Financial Services Authority (FSA) issued the warning over "fraudulent" Bitcoin investment scheme practiced by one of the unregistered tech companies. Besides that declaration FSA and the Central Bank of Seychelles (CBS) had kept silence on the subject of cryptocurrencies leaving operators in the grey legal area. Still, trading crypto as well as organizing ICOs are legal in Seychelles.
