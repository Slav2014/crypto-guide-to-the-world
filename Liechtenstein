	The Financial Market Authority (Finanzmarktaufsicht), which is the main financial regulator of the Principality, had created a precedent by approving ICO of the non-profit CBN Foundation in autumn 2017. Additionally, the Swiss franc (CHF) has been the currency of Liechtenstein since 1920. Therefor, the Swiss National Bank (SNB), which has already demonstrated its progressive stance on digital currencies, is de-facto responsible for the monetary policy of Liechtenstein. Those factors let us speculate about the possibility to create a safe-heaven for cryptocurrencies in this small European country.
