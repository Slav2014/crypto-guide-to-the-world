<h1>Austria </h1>

<p>

	Austria is considered to be a relatively crypto-friendly country, specially compare to neighboring Germany with its draconian laws regarding trading and buying crypto-currencies. However, the tide may be turning for Austrian crypto-users as some overzealous government's bureaucrats continue to express their misplaced concerns with the use of crypto-currencies for money laundering.
</p>
<p>
	Among the proposed "preventive" measures, which this government intends to promptly execute, are the following: crypto-currencies market participants will be obliged to disclose identities of all trading parties and to reveal trades exceeding 10,000 EURO to the financial espionage unit.
</p>
<p>
	It has already become a "good" tradition among officeholders of different ranks to blame new technologies for causing unproven and often even non-existing offenses. Looks like there's nothing else left for them to cover up their own professional ineptitude and general obsolescence. It's a pity that now even generally well-regarded Austrian financial functionaries have became sorrow victims of that hysterical paranoia.
