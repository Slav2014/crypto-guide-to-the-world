<h2 align = 'center'> Yemen (Republic of Yemen) </h2>

<p>
	In Yemen crypto-currencies are not regulated by the government, which makes it technically legal to trade crypto and to organize ICOs there. Moreover, Yemen's Central Bank stated that the Saudi-led coalition imposed a ban on flights bringing in newly printed currency notes from Russia which continues to strangle the Yemeni economy. That blockade has created an unique opportunity for wide-spread adaption of digital money in this troubled region of the world.
