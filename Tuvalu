<h2 align = 'center'> Tuvalu </h2>

<p>
	Tuvaluan regulatory system is based on the British law, which creates a better regulatory climate for tech entrepreneurs compare to neighboring Pacific states. However, under the present political, economic, social and demographic conditions the local startups ecosystem is lacking important incentives for grows.
</p>
<p>
	There is no central monetary authority or central bank in Tuvalu. The National Bank of Tuvalu (NBT) carries out some monetary functions for the government and provides banking services for population. However, the Tuvaluan dollar is not an independent currency, and it's pegged to the Australian dollar.
</p>
<p>
	NBT hasn't yet expressed its opinion on cryptocurrencies and trading digital cash as well as organizing ICOs both are technically legal in Tuvalu. However, there's a little doubts that, if necessary, NBT will at any time aling its official position on crypto with that of the Reserve Bank of Australia.
