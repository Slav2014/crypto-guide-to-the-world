<h2 align = 'center'> Belize </h2>
<p>
	Belize's main financial regulatory body - <a href="http://www.ifsc.gov.bz/">the International Financial Services Commission (IFSC)</a> - has appeared in crypto-news feeds a few times in a past couple of years to warn public about unlawful or suspicious activities of several crypto-companies. That, to say the least, is highly unusual for a state's monetary watchdog. We all have been already a little tired to see multiple presumptuous memorandums and nonsensical declarations issued by world's financial regulators, which right from the first page proclaim Bitcoin with the rest of crypto to be the enemy of humanity.
</p>
<p>
	Against this background IFSC looks as a typical Marvel's guardian of the galaxy, endowed with an ugly face, and manners but a just soul. Figuratively speaking, Belizean "Groot" is going after bad guys one by one as opposed to all-knowing "Ego's" indiscriminate slaughter. Matter of fact, compare to most world state finance guardians' quick-meal, flash-bang, shoot-first-ask-later modus operandi, IFSC's case-by-case approach to new digital economy participants may be considered as almost civilized.
</p>
<p>
	Of course, at this early stage of crypto-industry's life most of us would prefer to have either nor regulation at all or a self-regulatory body staffed with crypto-professionals instead of clueless politicians and greedy lawyers. Alas, it's not the direction things are aiming for most of us. Belizean crypto-community may feel proud for itself being able to steer clear of any official regulations for so long. Coupled with IFSC's relative civility that may provide crypto-enthusiasts in Belize with a shadow of hope for a better than average crypto-future.
