In 2014 The Central Bank of Trinidad and Tobago issued the warning on the use of cryptocurrencies, which, basically, stated that the concept of virtual currency has been already addressed under the framework established for electronic money by the Financial Institutions Act of 2008 of Trinidad and Tobago. This Act treats the issuance of virtual currency as the issuance of stored value or receipts of funds, which can be accepted as payment by persons other than the issuer.

This activity is defined within the context of business of a financial nature and requires the approval of the Central Bank. Bank also warned that potential users must be aware of the risks involved in virtual currencies investing and added that regulators seek to establish appropriate frameworks to manage this market. Still, trading cryptocurrencies and organizing ICOs are legal in the country.
