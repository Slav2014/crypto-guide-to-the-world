<p>
	It is legal to use cryptocurrencies in the Philippines. However, local authorities tries to closely supervised and regulate this area. The Central Bank of the Philippines has released BSP Circular N 944 entitled "Guidelines for Virtual Currency Exchanges", to provide guidelines on the legality of crypto-exchanges. BSP clarified that digital money will still not be considered a currency since it is neither issued or guaranteed by a central bank nor backed by any commodity. Filipino virtual exchanges are required to register with the "Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas" (BSP) as a Foreign Exchange Dealer (FXD), Money Changer (MC) and Remittance Agent (RA). Furthermore, other businesses who want to engage in crypto transfer needs to get registered with the BSP.
