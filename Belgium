<h1>Belgium</h1>

<p>
	Belgium government bureaucrats from <a href="https://www.nbb.be/en">The National Bank of Belgium (NBB)</a> and <a href="https://www.fsma.be/en">the Belgian Financial Services & Markets Authority (FSMA)</a>, which are responsible for forming country's financial politics, have more than once expressed their strong disapproval of all crypto-currencies, which fall outside of their own strict oversight.
</p>
<p>
	They are joined by the <a href="https://justice.belgium.be/fr/service_public_federal_justice">Federal Public Service Justice</a> head, who, after two cases of Bitcoin seizures had been revealed to the public by local press, called to strengthening of governmental control over all forms of digital money.  
</p>
<p>
	Such hostile predisposition of Belgian finance and legal gatekeepers towards crypto leaves little doubt that, although there are not yet specific regulations regarding digital money in Belgium, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5ojJP8q__8">it's just a question of time before</a> Belgium lawmakers lay their heavy hands on Belgium fledgling crypto-community.
