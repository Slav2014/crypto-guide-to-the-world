	In its <a href="http://www.banrep.gov.co/es/comunicado-01-04-2014"><i>"Comunicado Bitcoin"</i></a> dated back to April 2014, <a href="http://www.banrep.gov.co/en">the Banco de la Republica</a> declared that the new form of digitalized, cryptographically protected money is not a legal tender in Colombia. Among other things Banco stated: <a href="http://www.banrep.gov.co/es/comunicado-01-04-2014">"The only monetary and account unit in Colombia is the peso (bills and coins) issued by the Banco de la Republica. Bitcoin is not a currency in Colombia ... ."</a>
</p>
<p>
	Despite its relatively unobtrusive and, even, banal content this <i>Communicado</i>, for some mystical reason, had evoked a long-lasting confusion in local as well as world's mass-medias concerning the legality of crypto-currencies in this South American country. The state of general bafflement about crypto in Colombia was exacerbated even further, when the <a href="https://www.supersociedades.gov.co/SitePages/Inicio.aspx">Superintendencia de Sociedades</a> - a relatively obscure department of the Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Tourism - had stepped in this hotted dispute and delivered its own "clarification" of the Bitcoin "issue", dated at September 2017.
</p>     
<p>
	In their short but totally muddled two-pagers, which was, rather unhelpfully, named <a href="https://www.supersociedades.gov.co/nuestra_entidad/normatividad/normatividad_conceptos_juridicos/OFICIO%20220-207096.pdf"><i>"Illigal results of the business activity conducted under the multi-level scheme for the sale and placement of virtual currency"</i></a>, local bureaucrats managed to utterly confuse themselves by desperately trying to draw the direct line between the subject of rising Bitcoin world-wide popularity and the proliferation of local "investment clubs", tagged as "ponzi schemes" in this memorandum, in Bogota.
</p>
<p>
	As a result of those ill-informed efforts of local watchdogs to warn the public against non-existing threats, the issue of Bitcoin legality in Colombia has became even more fazed. Currently, after several additional more-or-less bedazzled statements have been made on crypto-themes by both <i>Banco</i> and <i>Superintendencia</i>, we, nonetheless, can conclude that Bitcoin is still legal in Colombia. However, this subject fully resides in a "gray" zone of local law and, taking into account totally non-friendly stance of Colombian financial regulators towards crypto (what is, of course, not so surprising), digital money issuance and usage in this country might be outlawed virtually overnight.
