<h2 align = 'center'> Nauru (Republic of Nauru) </h2>

<p>
	Nauru uses the Australian dollar as the legal tender and has no central bank. Accordingly, Nauru's financial authorities are likely to follow the Reserve Bank of Australia's guidances on crypto-currencies' regulations. Still, trading crypto as well as organizing ICOs are both legal in Nauru.
