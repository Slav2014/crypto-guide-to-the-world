<h2 align = 'center'> Palau (Republic of Palau) </h2>

<p>
	In Palau, there is no specific law concerning crypto-currencies. Therefor, trading crypto and organizing ICOs are both technically legal in there. Palau uses the US dollar as legal tender and has no central bank. Consequently, Palau financial regulators are likely to follow steps of their USA counterparts with regards to an up-coming regulation of digital economy.
