<h1> Ukraine </h1>

<p>
	In August 2017 the National Bank of Ukraine stated that besides the hryvnia there is not an other legal tender recognized by Ukranian law. Still, trading crypto-currency as well as organizing ICO are both legitimate businesses in this country.

	In their regulatory politics, which relate to digital currencies, Ukrainian bureaucrats closely follow steps of their Western counterparts. On October 6 2017 the bill, which requires cryptocurrencies to be taxed as a kind of property, which was modeled after the similar piece of legislation adapted by U.S.A. in 2014,  was introduced to the local parliament. It also calls for taxing cryptocurrency mining.
