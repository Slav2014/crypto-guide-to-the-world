<h2 align = 'center'> Luxembourg (Grand Duchy of Luxembourg) </h2>


<p>
	Duchy's financial regulators, including Banque centrale du Luxembourg (BCL) and the Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier (CSSF), haven't yet come up with specific legal framework regulating virtual currencies. At the same time, the general stance of local bureaucrats on the issue of crypto appears to be positive. It had first been confirmed in April 2016 when one of the largest crypto-exchanges announced that Luxembourg has granted it a payment institution license. Trading crypto as well as organizing ICOs is legal in Luxembourg and this status is unlikely to be changed in the nearest future.
