	"The government's position is clear, we don't recognize this (digital money) as legal currency as of now." That statement, made by India's finance minister on December 2017, is not the first time, when local officials address the issue of cryptocurrencies. Earlier, another high ranked Indian bureaucrat made an announcement that the Reserve Bank of India had no plans to regulate crypto. At the same time, it was reported that Inter-Disciplinary Committee within India's Ministry of Finance was actively investigating the legal status of digital currencies and considering the possibility of regulating this area. Later it was revealed that the Indian government committee has ruled in favor of regulating cryptocurrencies.

	Those contradictory statements confirmed the fact that Indian regulators have not been able to work out an unified approach to the issue of digital currencies governance. At the same time, Modi's demonetization policy, which major goal is to impose total government's control over the monetary flows within the country, can be undermined by cryptocurrencies, which major features are anonymity and decentralization. It highly increases the probability of Indian officials introducing harsh restrictions on the crypto-industry operators or banning Bitcoin completely. Meanwhile, trading cryptocurrencies as well as organizing ICOs remain technically legal in India.
