<h1>Estonia</h1>
<p>
	Estonia - the country of Skype - is supposed to be the champion of innovation but in case of crypto-currencies legislation this Baltic nation's regulators demonstrate notable conservatism. First, the Supreme Court of Estonia ruled that Bitcoin falls under the anti-money laundering law, which means that all crypto-currencies mediators must follow AML and KYC procedures. Then the Estonian Financial Supervisory Authority (EFSA) expressed an opinion that tokens, depending on their structure, might be considered as securities.

<p>
	Furthermore, following the report that Estonia had proposed launching its own token - the "Estcoin", a representative of the European Central Bank stated that "only the Euro is the legal tender and the monetary policy lies exclusively with the European Central Bank". That have left a little doubt that the Ministry of Finance and the Estonian Central Bank will fall in line with this out-dated politic.
