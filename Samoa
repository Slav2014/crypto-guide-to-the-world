<p>

	 In June 2017 the Central Bank of Samoa issued <a href="https://www.cbs.gov.ws/index.php/media/latest-news/beware-of-getting-rick-at-these-new-article-page/">a statement</a> warning against digital currency. It reads: "We wish to advise the general public to be very cautious and diligent in dealing with get rich quick schemes or digital currency investments. ... If you come across these difficult and complex financial concepts and investments, please contact the Central Bank of Samoa for more information." However, it looks like CBS itself has a very limited knowledge about cryptocurrencies. Meanwhile, trading digital money as well as organizing ICOs are still legal in Samoa.
