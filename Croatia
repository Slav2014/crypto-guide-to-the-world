<h1> Croatia </h1>

<p>
	According to some estimates (for example <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/croatia-launches-self-regulating-blockchain-organization-amidst-growing-worldwide-trend">look here</a>) Croatian crypto-community has reached twenty five thousands users at the beginning of 2018, which constitutes more than 0.6% of country's four million inhabitants. At the same time, <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/647374/worldwide-blockchain-wallet-users/">some sources</a> indicate that there are now about twenty five million block-chain wallets users globally, which is less than 0.3% of world's population.

	With Croatia doubling world's crypto-users average <a href="https://www.hnb.hr/en">Croatian National Bank (CNB)</a> takes a relatively relax, thoughtful stance on (how CNB calls it) <a href="https://www.hnb.hr/en/-/e-novac">"E-money"</a>, which contrasts sharply with sometimes frantically hostile approach to this issue demonstrated by many Eastern European financial watchdogs. Still, Croatian Kuna (HRV), which has been devalued against UDS for about 50% since 2008, is the only legal tender in the country. Being technically legal, Bitcoin and other crypto have remained largely outside of the Croatian regulation framework and are now defined as "virtual currency scheme", similar to Linden dollars used in the Second Life' avatars commercial interactions.
