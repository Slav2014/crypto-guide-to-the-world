	Venezuelan government, which, officially, has not legislated against cryptocurrencies, instead, had been persecuting Bitcoin miners, with police arresting them on false charges. State representatives argue that the cost of electricity, which is subsidized by the socialist government, weights too heavily on the budget. Still, trading crypto and organizing ICOs are technically legal in Venezuela. It's, however, unlikely that under present economic conditions the financial authorities, including "Banco Central de Venezuela" (BCV) and "Superintendencia de Bancos y Otras Instituciones Financieras", have sufficient resources to effectively regulate digital currencies.
