<h2 align = 'center'> Azerbaijan (Azerbaijan) </h2>
<p>
	The situation with digital currencies regulation on the territory of Azerbaijan is uncertain. On the one hand, the Central Bank of the Republic of Azerbaijan doesn't recognize any other means of payment other than Azerbaijan Manat. On the other hand, the same Bank has developed the draft law named "On payment services", which creates the legal framework for use of e-money. Meanwhile, trading cryptocurrencies as well as organizing ICOs remain technically legal in this country.
