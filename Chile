<h1>Chile</h1>

<p>
	The enthusiastic support, which crypto-currencies received from Chilean government has been gradually wearing out. After the first local crypto-exchange was created with funding coming from authorities, it soon hit the wall when one of the major Chilean banks discontinued its participation in this project. That was followed by the <a href="http://www.bcentral.cl/web/central-bank-of-chile/home">Banco Central de Chile</a>'s head commenting negatively on the perspectives of digital currencies. 
</p>
<p>
	However, that may only partially explain why besides the astounding success of <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-22/cryptomania-sprouts-in-chile-as-virtual-greenbeans-jump-70-000">"chaucha"</a> coin, cloned from Litecoin in December 2017, there has not been any other notable progress achieved in expanding crypto-currencies adaption in Chile.

<p>
	The number of merchants accepting digital money still remains negligible and legal status of crypto-currencies - largely undefined. For the country, which, just a while ago, claimed one of its main state's developmental objectives to be gaining the technological upper hand on the South American continent, such sluggishness in following the most promising trend in "tecnologia financiera" looks abnormal.
