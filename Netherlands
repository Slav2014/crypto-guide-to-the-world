<h2 align = 'center'> Netherlands (<i>Nederlands</i>) </h2>

<p>
	While trading cryptocurrencies and organizing ICOs is legal in The Netherlands, most exchanges apply strict Antiâ€“Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) standards. Meanwhile, according to the Dutch central bank (DNB), digital currencies fall outside the scope of the Dutch Financial Supervision Act, meaning the DNB does not have a supervisory authority over these currencies. However, the investigative arm of the Dutch tax authority (the FIOD) aims to prosecute unlicensed crypto traders.
</p>
<p>
	As part of that effort, the FIOD wants to have mixing services recognized as money-laundering indicators. Users of mixing services would be assumed guilty, unless they could prove otherwise. In sum, it indicates that, although, Dutch authorities follow the situation with digital currencies very closely there has been a clear discrepancy in their responses to this challenge. Under those conditions the future of crypto in The Netherlands remains uncertain.
