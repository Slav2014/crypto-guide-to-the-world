<h2 align = 'center'> Federated States of Micronesia </h2>

<p>
	The Federated States of Micronesia does not have laws regulating cryptocurrencies, which makes trading crpto or organizing ICOs technically legal in FSM. However, as an US associated state, which uses US dollar as a national currency, FSM will likely be closely following all future US FRB's policies concerning digital money.
