<h2 align = 'center'> Nigeria (Federal Republic of Nigeria) </h2>


<p>
	Nigerian state gate-keepers are not particularly friendly to Bitcoin as well as to other digital currencies. However, they also recognize their technical inability to restrain its usage by the public. Instead, local authorities try to prevent the adaptation of non-centralized electronic money by business and government institutions.
</p>
<p>
	In January 2017, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) sent a memorandum to banks and other financial institutions informing them that transactions in virtual currencies have been banned in Nigeria, citing money laundering and terrorism financing as reason for this ban. Other financial regulators, such as Nigeria Deposit Insurance Corporation (NDIC), have also warned public on the danger of digital currencies like Bitcoins, warning that who use digital currencies do so at their own risk.
</p>
<p>
	Nevertheless, trading cryptocurrencies as well as organizing ICOs are both technically legal in Nigeria.

	Business Notes for Startups Founders:
	<ul>		
		<li>political climate: not friendly;</li>
		<li>economic climate: moderately friendly;</li>
		<li>regions to focus: locally;</li>
		<li>industries to focus: many including e-commerce, e-services, entertainment, social networks, e-marketplaces, e-jobs and FinTech;</li>
		<li>major limitations: sharp GDP decline (growth rate is negative 1%), overdependence of country's exports on commodities market prices (specially on crude oil, which accounts for 9% of GDP, with daily production of 1.8 million barrels), high inflation (16%), very high CB interest rate (14%), high personal income tax rate (24%), very high administrative and legal barriers to SME, political instability;</li>
		<li>stimulus: communication sector is fast growing and already accounts for 10% of GDP, high-low-income population (per-capita exceeds $2500), fast growing generation of young mobile Internet users, fixed Internet penetration rate is close to 50%, matured startup ecosystem (notably in Lagos);</li>
		<li>opportunities: to build a variety of mobile services aimed at young generation of consumers.</li>
		<li>Cryptocurrencies and ICOs (outlook): legal (moderately negative).</li>
	</ul>
