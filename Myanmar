<h1> Myanmar </h1>

<p>
	Myanmar financial regulators, including the Central Bank of Myanmar, haven't yet presented their official position on crypto-currencies. Country's fixed Internet penetration rate is one of the lowest in the world (under 3%). Additionally, local stringent banking laws severely limit public access to financial services. With that Myanmar authorities have not real economic incentives to actively persecute crypto traders as well as other participants of digital economy.
</p>
<p>
	However, there always remains a chance that some high-positioned bureaucrats may suddenly find it necessary to make a political point by announcing harsh regulatory initiatives aimed at the local fledgling independent currencies market. Meanwhile, dealing on crypto as well as organizing ICOs, although technically not criminal, have remained marginalized in Myanmar.
