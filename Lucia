<h2 align = 'center'> Saint Lucia </h2>


<p>
	St. Lucia doesn't have laws regulating crypto-currencies. Moreover, the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB), which is the central bank for the Eastern Caribbean dollar and the monetary authority for the members of the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States, including St. Lucia, hasn't yet officially expressed its position on digital money. Those factors have made trading crypto as well as organizing ICOs legal and sound in Saint Lucia.
