	In Switzerland cryptocurrencies are not only being legitimized but also encouraged to grow.	The Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) has issued a license to several local banks to manage assets based on the blockchain technology such as bitcoin and other digital currencies. On the state level Switzerland has adopted the so-called ‘sandbox’ approach, which specifies several regions, where startups can experiment within controlled conditions.

	The famous example of that is the tiny Swiss town Zug, located in 20 miles south of Zurich, nicknamed "Crypto Valley", where such companies as Ethereum and Xapo are registered. Another example is the municipality of Chiasso, which intends to accept tax payments in Bitcoin.

	Swiss Finance Ministry has also promises to re-evaluate banking legislation to allow smaller companies in financial technology to obtain licenses. In short, Swiss regulators are not trying to fit digital currencies into the old, and often outdated, legal frameworks. Instead they approach them as they would the new, innovative financial services.
