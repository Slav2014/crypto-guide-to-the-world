<h2 align = 'center'> Tunisia (Republic of Tunisia) </h2>

<p>
	In 2015, Tunisian officials announced the project of eDinar - government backed block-chain currency. Additionally, in October 2017, the Central Bank of Tunisia launched four "reflection commissions", which main purpose is to prepare a roadmap on concrete measures and actions aimed at de-cashing the local economy using crypto. However, and notwithstanding other multiple initiatives put forward but various independent organizations and aimed at promoting crypto-currencies legalization in Tunisia, this sphere of digital economy remains largely unregulated. Still, trading crypto and organizing ICOs have remained technically legal in Tunisia.
