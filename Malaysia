	2 January 2014 Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) issued a following statement: <a href="http://www.bnm.gov.my/">"The Bitcoin is not recognized as legal tender in Malaysia. The Central Bank does not regulate the operations of Bitcoin. The public is therefore advised to be cautious of the risks associated with the usage of such digital currency".</a> On 4 October 2017, BNM announced that by the end of the year the decision on whether or not cryptocurrencies should be banned in Malaysia will be taken.
