<h1>Egypt</h1>
<p>
	Egypt has became one of those countries where crypto-community members are now obliged to live under the double pressure of ambiguous political statements and significant legal uncertainty.
</p>
<p>
	On the one side, the heads of two major local financial regulatory institutions - <a href="http://www.cbe.org.eg/en/Pages/default.aspx">the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE)</a> and <a href="http://www.fra.gov.eg/jtags/efsa_en/index_en.jsp">the Egyptian Financial Supervisory Authority (EFSA)</a> - have already publicly expressed their disapproval of digital money: one saying that non of local entities is allowed to trade crypto-currencies, while other rejecting the legality of crypto-transactions. It goes even further than that. Egyptian religious authorities have also found it necessary to join into this heated conversation by issuing the fatwa, which declares crypto-trading to be non-compatible with the Sharia law.
</p>
<p>
	On the other side, officially, there has not yet been issued any piece of regulation, which may explicitly make crypto illegal in Egypt. However, with so much of political muscles applied to the one side of this scale, there's now a little doubt left that the long-term future of crypto-currencies in Egypt is under serious threat.
