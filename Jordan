<h2 align = 'center'> Jordan (The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan) </h2>

<p>
	In February 2014 the Central Bank of Jordan sent a circular to local banks, financial companies, payment processors and currency exchangers prohibiting them from dealing with crypto-currencies. Additionally, CBJ published a note, which contains the following statement, aimed at the general public: "... virtual currencies are not legal tender and there is no obligation on any central bank in the world or any government to exchange its value for real money ...". However, despite those proclamations, buying or selling crypto as well as organizing ICOs have remained technically legal in Jordan and country's population as well as SME are allowed to trade on the crypto-market by using alternative channels.
