<h2 align = 'center'> Uruguay (Oriental Republic of Uruguay) </h2>

<p>
	At November 2017 "The Banco Central del Uruguay" (BCU) announced the launch of the national cryptocurrency. It said that a limited number of users would help testing a mobile app for the transfer of crypto. However, bank's officials soon followed with additional commentary stating that "it is not a cryptocurrency such as Bitcoins but a currency that remains the responsibility of the BCU".

<p>
	Despite all of those official ambiguities we may assume that Uruguayan regulators are generally disposed to adopt a reasonable, thoughtful approach to Internet money adaption in the country. Although there's no comprehensive crypto-law existing in Uruguay, both trading digital cash as well as organizing ICOs are legal in this country.
