In October 2017, according to the unconfirmed information, Vanuatu government started to accept Bitcoins as the legal form of payment. However, those rumors were later denied by local official representatives. Digital currencies stay in the gray legal zone in Vanuatu. Consequently, trading cryptocurrencies as well as organizing ICOs have remained technically legal in there.
