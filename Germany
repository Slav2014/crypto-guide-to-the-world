	Trading crypto and organizing ICOs are both legal in Germany. Moreover, Germany is one the most advanced countries when it comes to regulating virtual currencies. The German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) qualified cryptocurrencies as "units of account" and, therefore, financial instruments. BaFin stated that "units of account are comparable to foreign exchange with the difference that they do not refer to a legal tender". It allows digital cash to be used as legal currency for tax (to be taxed) and trading purposes.

	As to ICOs German regulators follows the guideline of The European Securities and Markets Authority which has stated, "Blockchain technology does not liberate users from the need to comply with the existing regulatory framework". It means that from the securities and regulatory perspective, the Banking Act, Investment Act, Securities Trading Act, Payment Services Supervision Act and Prospectus Acts are in force for all ICOs marketed on the territory of Germany.
