<h1> Algeria </h1>


<p>
	Crypto-currencies have long stayed overlooked by Algerian bureaucrats. Not anymore. In October 2017 there appeared an information in local medias that the National People's Congress (NPC) is on the verge of voting for 2018 Finance Bill, which will outlaw digital money purchase, sale, usage and ownership in the country. Reportedly, an anonymity of crypto-transactions is what primary bothering local lawmakers. Still, this ban has remained un-imposed and trading crypto is legal in Algeria.
