<h2>Iraq (Republic of Iraq)</h2>

<p>
	Iraqi financial authorities, including the Central Bank of Iraq (CBI), have not yet expressed their official view on cryptocurrencies. Meanwhile, as digital money sector stay unregulated, trading crypto as well as organizing ICOs remain technically legal in Iraq. In the foreseeable future, due to the low Internet penetration rate as well as to general lack of technical capabilities on a governmental level, to regulate this sphere will be both difficult and ineffective there.
