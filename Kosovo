<h1>Kosovo</h1>

<p>
	Kosovo crypto-community still exists largely outside of financial regulatory boundaries. In July 2017, soon after the first Bitcoin ATM was expected to be placed right in the heart of Pristina, the Central Bank of Kosovo - <a href="https://www.bqk-kos.org/">Banka Qendrore e Republikes se Kosoves</a> issued a declaration warning potential users on an absence of reimbursement guarantees associated with digital money.
</p>
<p>
	This announcement was remarkably toned down compare to the great majority of similar in nature proclamations issued by mainstream finance gate-keepers all over the world. Among other things this highly unusual civil tone, used by the local banking establishment to address crypto-currencies issue, may be explained by the fact that Kosovo, without being an official member of the Eurozone, long ago had adapted Euro as its local currency.
</p>
<p>
	After all, if the <a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/home/html/index.en.html">European Central Bank</a>, which oversees the financial destiny of over 340 million humans, feels itself <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/07/bitcoin-ecb-says-regulating-cryptocurrencies-is-not-high-on-our-to-do-list.html">unperturbed</a> by crypto-revolution then why shall Kosovo, with its population under 2 million, care at all?
