	Ireland has already acquired its first Bitcoin ATM, a bar and the native cryptocurrency ( Gaelcoin). However, still, virtual currencies remain unregulated in Ireland and has yet to be recognized as legal tender. Moreover, the Irish Central Bank has declared that it foresees a dual economy of digital currency and state based fiat currencies, which is an exemplary progressive stance compare to that of other EU financial regulators. Consequently, in the short-term, we do not expect any knee-jerking reactions to crypto from part of local finance system's gate-keepers. Meanwhile, both trading digital cash as well as organizing ICOs stay legal in Ireland.
