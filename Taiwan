<h1>Taiwan</h1>

<p>
	As in many other countries around the world crypto-currencies started off on the wrong foot in Taiwan. In November 2015 a wealthy Hong Kong merchant was badly beaten and then ransomed for a great deal of Bitcoins by unidentified culprits. That sparkled an immediate reaction from the head of the main securities regulator - <a href="https://www.fsc.gov.tw/en/index.jsp">Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC)</a> - who staunchly proclaimed crypto to be from now on "illegal" in Taiwan.
</p>
<p>
	Soon enough this statement had been officially denounced and claimed on an inaccurate journalist's reporting. Instead of banning digital money, authorities claimed, FSC will only make sure that crypto-currencies are to be used for "legal purposes". General public was also referred to the joint communique issued in 2013 by FSC in a collaboration with the <a href="http://www.cbc.gov.tw/mp2.html"> Central Bank of the Republic of China (Taiwan)</a>. This product of bureaucratic genius had found Bitcoin to be of the "non-currency nature" and tagged as the "virtual commodity".
</p>
<p>
	That, of course, besides being plain stupid also created a legal conundrum, which is similar in nature to that, which followed the US IRS's decision to treat Bitcoins as "assets" subjected its to the capital gain tax. On a positive side, this short-sited decision, at least temporarily, put crypto-currencies in Taiwan outside of the immediate blast area covered by bureaucratic weapon of entrepreneurship mass-destruction.
</p>
<p>
	However, in October 2017, one of the Taiwanese Central Bank's top dogs reiterated the issue, saying that Bitcoin transactions must be subjected to the intense money anti-laundering scrutiny, which, once again, placed Taiwanese crypto-community on the edge. Nevertheless, it's still very unlikely that local regulators will follow steps of their Chinese counterparts by blowing crypto completely out of the local financial pond's water.
