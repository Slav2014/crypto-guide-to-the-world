<h2 align = 'center'> Barbados </h2>

<p>
	The Central Bank of Barbados (CBB) has been playing with an idea of adapting cryptocurrencies to its use for quite a while. In December 2015 CBB hinted that Bitcoins may be added to its foreign currency reserves. In April 2016 a bank's representative stated that CBB is willing to test the idea to put Barbadian Dollars, which is currently pegged to USA dollar in a proportion two-to-one, on the blockchain. Still digital currencies stay unregulated in Barbados, which makes trading crypto as well as organizing ICOs technically legal there.
