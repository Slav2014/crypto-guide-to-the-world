<h2 align = 'center'> Vatican City (Vatican City State) </h2>


<p>
	Independent and well-informed observers have already recognized the existence of Holy See's long-term and intimate relationships with foreign currencies. Now it also includes crypto. In April 2016 Vatican City was rumored to introduce the first sovereign decentralized crypto-currency. Those plans, however, remain unfulfilled. Still, due to the absence of legal acts regulating this sphere, trading crypto as well as organizing ICOs is legal in Vatican.
