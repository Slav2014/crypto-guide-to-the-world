	Confronted by the macro-economical issues, the Reserve Bank of South Africa (SARB) has been among the slowest of the advanced economies to face the cryptocurrencies legal dilemma. In December 2014 SARB issued a note on digital currencies declaring that virtual currency had "no legal status or regulatory framework". Later, the SARB had announced that it will begin to trial a number of regulations aimed at Internet money. In February 2017, SARB showed its intentions to develop a national virtual currency that would be based on blockchain. Meanwhile, trading Bitcoin and other crypto as well as organizing ICOs stay legal in South Africa.
