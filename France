	Although trading digital currencies and organizing ICOs remain technically legal in France, national finance gate-keepers have seemed to be taken ill-informed approach to its regulation. The Bank of France representative said that, under the French law, Bitcoin cannot be considered as a legal currency. Moreover, its governor stated that the digital, "speculative" asset is not "even a cryptocurrency" (sic). "The Autorite des marches financiers" (AMF) announced that ICOs have no legal status under French law. The AMF president also stated that there are "various issues" relating to cryptocurrency. At the same time, French government officials said that although they do not officially recognize Bitcoin as a currency, they can still impose income taxes.
