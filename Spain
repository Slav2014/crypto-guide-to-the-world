<h2 align = 'center'> Spain (Kingdom of Spain) </h2>

<p>
	Spain is considered to be generally cryptocurrency friendly country. However, this statement is based on an absence of specific regulations addressing digital currencies in the Spanish legal jurisdiction and on the here-says of local bureaucrats. For example, the General Directorate of Taxes, a subsidiary of the Spanish taxing authorities, made the statement that Bitcoin transactions are exempt from value-added-tax (VAT). The Spanish Ministry of Finance said that it plans to tax Bitcoin mining profits up to 47 percent, which will effectively recognizing this type of business as a legal taxable activity.

<p>
	According to the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), Bitcoin cannot be considered as a legal tender in Spain. Also, Bitcoin must comply with the Spanish Anti Money Laundering Act in several cases. However, in February 2015, the European Central Bank stated that cryptocurrencies are not regulated yet and they are not subject to the scope of application of the Payment Services Directive and the Electronic Money Directive.

 <p>
 	Consequently, we should wait for the Spanish and/or EU authorities to work out more systemic legal tactic regarding digital money. Meanwhile, trading crypto as well as organize ICOs are technically legal in Spain. Moreover, the rising competition from part of the neighboring states and territories (for example, Gibraltar) in the field of financial technologies makes it less likely that Spain will took a hard-line approach to crypto.
