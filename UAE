<h2 align = 'center'> United Arab Emirates </h2>


<p>
	The status of crypto-currencies in the United Arab Emirates is far from being resolutely set by its government. Almost immediately after the publication of the "Regulatory Framework For Stored Values and Electronic Payment Systems" by UAE Central Bank in January 2017, which, in its section D.7.3. "Provisions for Virtual Currencies", firmly and unambiguously stated that "all virtual currencies (and any transactions thereof) are prohibited", there was 180 degree turn made by one of the Bank's most distinguished representatives - his governor himself.
</p>
<p>
	He said in interview to one of the local news agencies that "these regulations do not cover virtual currency" and these "regulations do not apply to Bitcoin or other crypto-currencies". It revealed a conflict of interests, which apparently exists inside of UAE government. We can assume that after the above mentioned report was made public some very important state official(s) privately demonstrated his (their) disapproval of this report, which then caused central bank's directors to denounce his official position on crypto.
</p>
<p>
	However, judging by a reportage, which appeared in medias at the end of October 2017, UAE bank's head still keeps his negative attitude toward crypto-currencies, which he sharply criticized for the lack of supervision, claiming that "it facilitates money laundering and terrorism financing". The fact that this high-ranking bureaucrat has again openly expressed his anti-crypto views may have far reaching consequences. It also may signify the beginning of new stage of legislative crack-down on digital currencies in UAE.

<p>
	Meanwhile, despite of the absence of legal persecution precedences, trading crypto as well as organizing ICOs remains legally risky in UAE.
