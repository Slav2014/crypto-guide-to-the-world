<h1> Marshall Islands </h1>

<p>
	After Russia (in October 2017), Venezuela (January 2018) and Iran (February 2018), <a href="https://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/26551.htm">Marshall Islands</a> has became the fourth state, which declared loudly its intention to issue the government-backed "crypto-currency". Obviously, as in all preceding cases, this new attempt to centralize the decentralized digital Store-of-Value-Unit-of-Account-and-Medium-of-Exchange will only add more confusion to already disorientated crypto-market.   
</p>
<p>
	Obviously, needed lessons haven't been learned from Nicolas Maduro's experiment with "petro", which, after purportedly raising more than $730 million from the unknown number of international crypto-investors, has been successively outlawed, first, by Venezuelan parliament and, then, by the White House administration. Not to mention, of course, that Russian CryptoRuble and Iranian Post Bank's crypto-coin have until now remained pure declarations.
</p>
<p>
	Whether or not Marshallese Sovereign (SOV) will follow suit is yet to be seen. However, as crypto continues to gain prominence among mainstream bankers and politicians, similar in nature attempts undertaken by adventurous state bureaucrats to make a very quick buck will not stop to amaze all of us by its lack of basic economic considerations.
