	Sweden together with Norway and Denmark are striving to become cashless countries. Bitcoin and its peers are right up to Sweden authorities' alley. Not surprisingly then that "Sveriges Riksbank" (Sweden's central bank) is considering issuing a digital currency of its own. However, there are no laws in Sweden regulating digital currencies use. So far it has been substituted by government's departmental bylaws. For example, the Swedish Tax Agency has given a preliminary ruling on Value Added Tax (VAT) on Bitcoins, stating that trade in Bitcoins is not subject to Value Added Tax. At the same time, Finansinspektionen (Financial Supervisory Authority) is more likely to be treating Bitcoins as a currency. Meanwhile, trading crypto and organizing ICOs stay legal in Sweden.
