	Georgia is the Bitcoin-friendly state. In February 2017 Georgia become one of the first countries in the world to implement the distributed ledger platform into government services. The Republic of Georgia's National Agency of Public Registry (NAPR) signed an agreement to use the blockchain to verify property transactions. The National Bank of Georgia provides local financial companies with license, which, among other things, allows the organization "to process Bitcoin or its very own crypto currency." However, although trading cryptocurrencies and organizing ICOs both are technically legal in Georgia, this sphere still remains widely unregulated.
