<h1> Botswana </h1>

<p>
	Botswana belongs to a shrinking group of countries, where regulatory authorities still vastly disregard the local crypto-market. Despite recent surge of interest to this issue across the world <a href="http://www.bankofbotswana.bw/">The Bank of Botswana</a> (BoB) continues to withhold official commentaries on its position towards regulating digital money.
</p>
<p>
	However, that may be explained not by the existence of some silent none-interventionist faction inside of the Botswana government. Crypto-currencies have mostly infiltrated into this country through cloud-mining operators and organizers of multi-level marketing (MLM) networks. The adaption rate of crypto remains extremely low and the number of block-chain startups in Botswana is not exceeding a dozen. At the same time, there is no local crypto-exchange and residents are trading through popular messengers' groups.    
</p>
<p>
	That minimum level of crypto-related activity in Botswana has kept regulators' focus somewhere else, but there's a little doubt that as soon as BTC or ETH make a visible splash in a relatively shallow pond of the local finance this situation is to be changed and not to the full satisfaction of crypto-enthusiasts.
